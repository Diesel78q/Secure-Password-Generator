Project Name: Secure Password Generator

Description:
This project is a basic password generator program that generates secure passwords based on user preferences. It allows users to specify the quantity and length of passwords, as well as choose whether to include digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and certain punctuation symbols. The program also provides an option to exclude ambiguous characters for enhanced security. The project was developed to demonstrate password generation techniques during the learning process and written in Python.

Key Features:
- Uses randomization techniques from the `random` module for secure password generation.
- Prompts the user to enter the quantity and length of passwords they want to generate.
- Asks for user preferences on including digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and specific punctuation symbols.
- Provides an option to exclude ambiguous characters (such as "il1Lo0O") for improved readability and security.
- Constructs a character set (`chars`) based on the user's preferences.
- Defines a function (`generate_password`) to generate a password of the specified length from the given character set.
- Calls the `generate_password` function to generate the specified quantity of passwords and prints them.

Please note that the password generated by this program is as strong as the randomness of the underlying algorithm and the length and complexity of the chosen character set. It is recommended to use long and complex passwords and regularly update them for better security.

This project serves as a foundational example of a password generator program and demonstrates the utilization of randomization techniques for creating secure passwords based on user preferences. ðŸ˜Š
